# Introduction

Welcome to the Bloomscape Engineering coding challenge!

We know that you're spending plenty of your personal time meeting with our team
and participating in the interview process. With that in mind, this step is
designed to be quick and a way for you to showcase your coding and architecture
skills.

We've creating a coding challenge that is aligned to the types of projects and
problems that we see at Bloomscape. We will be reviewing 

## Problem

Create a [vending machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vending_machine) in
the language of your choice. The vending machine can sell any product that you
wish.

Your project can take the form of either an API or a UI -- you do not have to
implement both!

*Please spend at most 8 hours on this project.*

**Objectives:**

* Represent a basic data model for the vending machine -- consider things like
  how to pay and how to receive a product.
* Prototype a simple UI or API endpoints that allows someone to interact with
  the machine.
* You are free to use any language and framework that you wish -- we commmonly
  use Typescript, JavaScript, PHP, and Python, along with frameworks like
  React, Next.js, Flask, and WordPress.
* Please use any boilerplate or starter project that you like -- we want to see
  the way that you build applications and are less concerned with your ability
  to craft perfect project infrastructures.
* Be ready to talk about your solution - we'll discuss together in your final
  technical interview.

**Things you don't need:**

* Both an API and a working UI -- we'd rather see depth than breadth.
* Persistence -- in-memory is totally sufficient.
* Full implementation of the machine -- one or two actions is enough.

## Instructions

* Please fork this repo
* Create pull requests early and often as you work -- you may merge your own 
  code, but we want to see how you break down the problem
* Ask any questions that you want -- just tag `@Bloomscape-tech-team` in
  Github.

## What We're Looking For

* Your ability build a simple application with an open-ended problem description
* Technical skill in a language/framework of your choosing
* How you breakdown problems -- your thought process is as, or more, important
  than your solution
